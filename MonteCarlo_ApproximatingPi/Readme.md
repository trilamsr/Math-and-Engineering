# Approximating Pi using Monte Carlo



## What's Monte Carlo 

Monte Carlo simulation is understood as probability.

If you flip the coin, assuming perfect 50-50 probability, then with each incremental flip as n of flip approach âˆž

**Expect:**

        No.(head) / No.(tail) ~= 1
    Or: No.(head) ~= No.(tail)

## What's happening in this algorithm

It's a litter bit of reverse engineering.
